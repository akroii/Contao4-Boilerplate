# Contao4-Boilerplate
Sceleton for files and folders.

## What it does:
### improves mandatory form fields in template
By default form templates was beeing marked with a star. Now, only field which are not mandatory beein marked. this improves UX. It is not recommended to mark every single field with (optional) to inform users that this field is necessary.


I will add more features in future...
