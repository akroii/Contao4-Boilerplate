# Contao4-Boilerplate
Sceleton for files and folders.

## What it does:
### improves mandatory form fields in template
By default form templates was beeing marked with a star. Now, only fields which are not mandatory beein marked. This improves UX. It is not recommended to mark every single form field with a star to inform users which field is necessary.

## Order stylesheets this way:
1. files/assets/css/normalize.css
2. files/assets/css/bootstrap.css 
3. files/assets/css/bootstrap-ms.css
4. files/assets/css/bootstrap-3-vert-offset-shim.css
5. files/assets/css/font-import.css
6. files/assets/css/fix.css
7. files/assets/css/forms.css
8. files/assets/css/navigation.css
9. files/assets/css/typo.css
10. files/assets/css/breadcrumb.css
11. files/assets/css/style.css
12. files/assets/css/lists.css
13. files/assets/css/responsive.css




I will add more features in future...
